I know it's a bit messy. Please try to ignore all the resources file.   
Qt's resource management puts all resources in the root directory by default.   
Most codes are in [`.h` and `.cpp` files](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Azwzheng-ALPJ%2Fserver%20(path%3A*.cpp%20OR%20path%3A*.h)&type=code).
